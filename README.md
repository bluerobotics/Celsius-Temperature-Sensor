# Celsius Temperature Sensor

Arduino software library is available [here](http://github.com/bluerobotics/BlueRobotics_TSYS01_Library/).

The schematic and board layout are designed in EagleCAD.

## Description

High accuracy, fast time response subsea temperature sensor with I<sup>2</sup>C interface. It has a measurement accuracy of just &plusmn;0.1&deg;C.

The sensor is the Measurement Specialties TSYS01, It comes standard with a 4-pin DF13 connector and compatible with most DroneCode compatible boards including the APM2.6, PixHawk, and others.

## Features

* &plusmn;0.1&deg;C Accuracy
* Standard DF13 connector for connection to DroneCode boards such as APM, PixHawk, Navio2, etc.
* Sealed in a bulkhead penetrator for easy installation into any 10mm hole

## Compatibility

The Celsius sensor is compatible with any device with 3.3V I<sup>2</sup>C logic. When using with a 5V device, such as an Arduino Uno, it is necessary to use a logic level converter.

## Configuration

The sensor is mounted on a PCB that extends into the water and is sealed from water with a thick layer of thermally conductive epoxy. This mounting method minimizes heat capacitance and ensures a fast time-response.
